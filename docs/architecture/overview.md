## 1. Purpose and Scope

`agent_framework` is a generic, **LLM-agnostic**, markdown-defined agent runtime, orchestration host, tracing, and evaluation toolkit. Its purpose is to decouple agent behavior definitions from provider-specific LLM SDKs, enabling the same agent definitions to run against OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or any custom provider through a thin `ModelDriver` protocol.

The framework ships with an `OpenAiModelDriver` (synchronous, Responses API) and a `DialChatCompletionsDriver` (async, DIAL/OpenAI-compatible chat completions). Both implement the same `ModelDriver`/`AsyncModelDriver` protocols and inherit a shared **`ModelDriverBase`** for runtime prompt assembly (`system.md` + mode templates). Custom provider drivers are first-class extension targets — the architecture is explicitly designed to accommodate them without modifying agent definitions.

**What it is:**
- A runtime for executing markdown-defined agents with a structured decision loop
- An orchestration host managing agent registries, tool execution, and multi-agent call hierarchies
- A scoped memory subsystem for URI-addressed shared runtime resources and deterministic memory projection
- A tracing and audit system for recording LLM calls, decisions, and agent interactions
- A **unified runtime tracer** (`tracing.py`) for structured `TraceEvent` streams with pluggable subscribers (JSONL, LLM log files, debugger bridges) and logging ingress via `LoggingTraceHandler`
- A separate **`agent_framework_evaluator`** package (CLI `agent-eval`, local FastAPI + WebSocket UI) for interactive debugging and headless runs on top of the same `AgentHost`
- An evaluation framework for regression testing agent behavior

**What it is not:**
- An application or domain-specific agent
- Tied to any particular LLM provider or API shape
- A framework for training or fine-tuning models

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Markdown-as-Contract

Agents and tools are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The LLM-facing contract — system prompts, user prompt templates, parameter declarations, capability allowlists — lives in `.md` files, not Python classes. This separates behavior specification from runtime implementation: prompts can be edited, versioned, and reviewed without touching Python code, and parameter specs are colocated with the prompts that use them.

### 2.2 Protocol-Based Abstraction

`ModelDriver`, `AsyncModelDriver`, `ConversationStore`, `AsyncConversationStore`, and `AgentHostProtocol` are all `typing.Protocol` classes, not abstract base classes. Any object satisfying the structural method signatures works — enabling dependency injection, test fakes, and provider swapping. Reference drivers (`OpenAiModelDriver`, `DialChatCompletionsDriver`) **inherit `ModelDriverBase`** for shared capability metadata and merge behavior; test **`FakeModelDriver`** implements `ModelDriver` structurally without inheriting `ModelDriverBase`, which is also valid.

### 2.2b Driver Capabilities

Drivers declare their runtime capabilities via a `ClassVar[DriverCapabilities]` attribute. This allows callers to introspect whether a driver is async, supports multimodal content, `response_format`, tools, or streaming — without making a live API call. `get_driver_capabilities(driver)` returns the declared capabilities or safe defaults for legacy drivers that predate this mechanism.

### 2.3 Immutable Event and State Dataclasses

All hook events, decisions, and results are `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`. Per-invocation mutable state is isolated in `AgentRun` objects (one per agent run). Immutability makes the system easier to reason about across threads and hook chains, prevents accidental mutation of event data after firing, and enables `dataclasses.replace()` for audit record construction.

### 2.4 Template Method Pattern for the Run Loop

`Agent.run()` is a `final` orchestration method that calls a sequence of overridable step methods (`build_context`, `decide`, `dispatch_decision`, `should_continue`, `before_iteration`, `after_iteration`, `resolve_runtime_decision`, `complete_without_result`). Subclasses extend behavior at specific steps without re-implementing the full loop. This is the classic Template Method pattern applied to an agent decision loop.

### 2.5 Hook-Driven Extensibility

Eight `SequentialHook` instances on `Agent` (pre/post for agent, tool, subagent, model) plus `AgentBehavior` classes provide non-invasive extension without modifying core loop logic. Behaviors are loaded dynamically from Python modules at agent load time. Hook callbacks receive typed event objects and can return decision objects that control execution flow — short-circuiting, injecting messages, modifying inputs, or requesting loop continuation.

### 2.6 Hierarchical Agent Orchestration

Agents invoke other agents as subagents via the host. The call tree is explicit, not emergent: each agent has a declared `allowed_child_agents` allowlist, and `CallContext` objects track each call edge with correlation IDs. Subagents can be invoked synchronously (`call_subagent`) or asynchronously via a shared thread pool (`call_subagent_async`).

### 2.6c Workflow orchestration

Not all parent orchestration should consume an LLM turn. The runtime exposes an agent-owned workflow surface through `WorkflowAgent`, `Agent.execute_programmatic_workflow(...)`, and the `ProgrammaticWorkflow*` step types.

First-class workflow agents are selected by adjacent runtime metadata (`agent_type: "workflow"`) and load a Python module that exports `build_workflow(agent) -> ProgrammaticWorkflow`. The `.md` file still defines identity, parameters, prompts, and allowlists; the Python module defines the graph, branches, parallelism, transforms, validation, and optional same-agent model phases.

This is intentionally not a host shortcut. The workflow runner reuses the same parent-side subagent orchestration internals that back model-driven `call_subagent` and `call_subagents` decisions. That preserves:

- parent hook execution around subagent calls
- parent transcript and prompt-fragment updates
- audit events for single-child and batch-child orchestration
- callback routing and blocked-batch resume behavior already implemented in the host
- shared in-run conversation context across workflow model phases

Architecturally, this keeps workflow controller logic at the agent layer while avoiding a second, divergent orchestration stack in `host.py`. Behavior-based `Agent.execute_programmatic_workflow(...)` remains a compatibility path; new workflow agents should use the sidecar-declared `WorkflowAgent` runtime.

### 2.6d Run-scoped evaluator model overrides

The evaluator can now override the model used by the agent under test without editing `.env` or adjacent runtime `.json` files. This is intentionally implemented as a runtime concern, not as evaluator-only branching.

Two scopes exist:

- `root_only` — only the tested/top-level agent is overridden for that run
- `all_agents` — every agent loaded and executed during that run is overridden

The split is architectural, not cosmetic:

- `root_only` is applied at root invocation time in `AgentHost.run_agent(...)` by cloning the resolved root agent with replacement `model_names`
- `all_agents` is applied at agent-load time through `AgentRegistry`, so it supersedes `.env` `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `.env` `AGENT_MODELS`, and adjacent runtime `.json` `model` declarations for the host instance used by that evaluator run

This keeps the semantics in the same layers that already own model resolution. The evaluator UI and CLI only transport the override contract; they do not implement a second model-selection system.

### 2.6b Skills as a Third Capability Pillar

Alongside tools and subagents, **skills** are a first-class agent capability. Skills are directory-discovered, markdown-defined behavioral instruction sets — reusable knowledge fragments that the model can invoke by name rather than implementing the same instructions in every agent prompt.

**Three-tier loading** keeps context usage proportional to need:
1. **Catalog** (names + descriptions) — always present as a first-turn conversation message (injected by `build_context()` as a `{"role": "user"}` message at index 2, before run conversation history) inside `<available_skills>` so the model knows what skills exist.
2. **Body** (full skill content) — loaded on demand when the model emits an `invoke_skill` decision; injected as a user message in `conversation_messages`, not into the system prompt.
3. **Resources** (individual files) — accessible to the model via the base directory path injected into the skill fragment; no separate tool call is required.

Skills are **model-invoked** via the `invoke_skill` decision kind in the agent decision loop. Context isolation is strict: skill content is injected only as a `conversation_messages` user message and never merged into `system_prompt` or `prompt_fragments`.

### 2.7 Unified Callback Protocol

All escalations from an agent to its caller flow through a single `callback` decision kind with six typed intents: `information_request`, `proposal_review`, `execution_recovery`, `delegation_return`, `policy_or_approval`, `guardrail_trip`. This creates a clean, uniform boundary between agent execution and human/caller interaction. All six intent strings normalize to `kind="callback"`; the caller resolves each based on the intent value.

### 2.8 Prompt Augmentation via Fragments

Rather than rebuilding the full user prompt each iteration, tool results, subagent results, and callback responses are accumulated as typed XML fragments in `AgentRun.prompt_fragments` and wrapped in `<augmentations>` before each model call. `_upsert_prompt_fragment()` applies replace-by-tag-name semantics, so the latest tool result replaces the previous one for the same tool — avoiding context bloat. Behaviors can replace specific fragment tags or append new ones via `AgentEndHookDecision`.

`WorkflowModelStep` is the exception for workflow-local LLM phases. It defaults
to chat-history semantics: the initial rendered prompt is appended once, phase
prompts are user messages, phase results are semantic assistant projections,
and workflow state summaries are not injected into provider-facing context
unless the step explicitly opts into legacy prompt-fragment behavior.
Phase prompts are append-only by default, but a step can mark its prompt
`prompt_history_policy="ephemeral"` so the active prompt is visible for its
phase call and then removed from later LLM-visible history after the semantic
projection is appended.
Phase prompts can also use `PromptRef("agent:<id>#workflow")` to resolve a
sidecar-controlled workflow projection of a standalone agent prompt, preserving
that standalone prompt as the source of truth.
When a workflow uses this chat-history mode, deterministic workflow outputs
and action-loop results from transforms, tools, subagents, callbacks, and
skills are also appended as later conversation messages instead of being
re-rendered into the early `<augmentations>` block. That keeps provider input
prefixes append-only and cacheable across workflow-local LLM phases.

### 2.9 Immutable Audit Records via Replace

`InMemoryAuditTracer` uses `dataclasses.replace()` to progressively build up frozen `AgentCallAuditRecord` objects across LLM requests, responses, decisions, callbacks, and events. Records are never directly mutated. When a run completes, the final record is serialized as a JSONL line and appended to the output file — an append-only, immutable audit trail.

### 2.10 Lazy Loading with Registry Caching

Agents and tools are loaded from the filesystem on first access and cached by ID and source path. Agent resolution follows a priority chain: registry → explicit path → sibling path → configured agent directory. This enables relative agent discovery (an agent can reference another by a path relative to itself) while maintaining a central cache.

## 3. Key Design Decisions

### Why Markdown Definitions Instead of Python Classes for Agents

Separating the LLM-facing contract from runtime code has several benefits: prompts and parameter specs can be edited without modifying Python; multiple agent variants can share the same runtime logic with different prompts; the contract is readable and reviewable as text; and non-programmers can author or modify agents. The sidecar `.json` file handles runtime configuration (model, temperature, behaviors) that doesn't belong in the prompt contract.

### Why `typing.Protocol` Over `ABC`

Structural subtyping enables test fakes and alternative implementations without inheritance. Any object with the right method signatures satisfies the protocol — a `FakeModelDriver` in tests doesn't need to import or inherit from a framework class. This also prevents the framework from leaking into provider implementations and avoids the diamond inheritance problems that ABC hierarchies accumulate.

### Why Frozen Dataclasses for Events and Decisions

Events fired into hook callbacks must not be mutated after firing — a hook that modifies an event would create non-obvious side effects on other hooks. `frozen=True` makes this a runtime error rather than a silent bug. `slots=True` reduces memory overhead for the many small dataclasses created per agent run. Hashability (from frozen) is a bonus for caching and set operations.

### Why Sequential Hooks Instead of Pub/Sub

Ordered, synchronous callback lists are simple to reason about. Pre-hooks that return `final_result` short-circuit cleanly — the runtime inspects the return value and stops processing. Pub/sub would add indirection and subscription management without benefit given the synchronous, single-threaded execution model of each agent run. The `SequentialHook` implementation is intentionally minimal: `+=`, `-=`, and iteration.

### Why Sidecar JSON for Runtime Metadata

YAML frontmatter holds the agent contract — parameter declarations, tool allowlists, subagent allowlists — things callers need to know before invocation. The sidecar `.json` holds runtime configuration — provider, model, temperature, behaviors — implementation details that callers don't need. This keeps the public contract clean and allows runtime configuration to change without modifying the prompt definition.

### Why `dataclasses.replace()` for Audit Records

Audit records must be trustworthy: a record must not be silently modified after the fact. Building them immutably via `replace()` — adding LLM request, then response, then decision, then callbacks — gives the appearance of progressive construction without allowing direct mutation. The JSONL output is append-only and never modified after writing.

### Why `CallContext` Tracking

Explicit call edges with correlation IDs enable tracing of complex multi-agent conversations where the same agent might be called from multiple callers simultaneously. Status transitions (`open` → `resolved`) make it clear when a callback or subagent call completes. The context stack in `AgentRun.contexts` provides a complete record of all call edges from a single run.

### Why `_normalize_decision_capabilities()`

LLM models frequently confuse tool names and subagent IDs, placing one in the wrong slot. Rather than failing with an unhelpful error, the runtime applies six heuristic repair cases to recover gracefully. This is a pragmatic acknowledgment that LLM outputs are probabilistic — the framework prefers resilience over strictness at the decision-parsing boundary.

```

**LLM Providers (external):**
- OpenAI API — implemented via `OpenAiModelDriver`, calls `client.responses.create()` (sync)
- DIAL (EPAM AI DIAL) — implemented via `DialChatCompletionsDriver`, calls OpenAI-compatible chat completions (async, install with `pip install agent_framework[dial]`)
- Custom APIs — extension point, any implementation of `ModelDriver` or `AsyncModelDriver`

**Filesystem (local):**
- Agent `.md` definitions (YAML frontmatter + system prompt + user prompt template)
- Optional sidecar `.json` files (runtime metadata per agent)
- Tool `.md` + `.py` pairs (contract + implementation)
- Optional `behaviors/` directory (Python modules for `AgentBehavior` implementations)
- `.env` configuration file (API keys, directories, model settings)
- `logs/` directory (JSONL audit trace output, LLM request/response logs, optional unified trace JSONL)
- Evaluation XML/JSON input files and JSON output artifacts

**User I/O:**
- `UserCommunication` protocol — `ConsoleUserCommunication`, `WebUserCommunication`, `NullUserCommunication`; wired on `AgentHost.user_comm`
- Deprecated: `input_reader` / `output_writer` kwargs on `from_env` are ignored; use `user_comm` or `from_env_console`
- Unified tracing (`TraceEvent` / `RuntimeTracer`) can capture `user.*` and mirrored console lifecycle lines when a run is scoped (see [Tracing & Evaluation](./tracing-evaluation.md))

**Python Runtime:**
- Dynamic module loading for tool implementations (`importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`)
- Dynamic module loading for behavior extensions (same mechanism)

## 5. Package Structure

The framework has a two-layer structure:

### Top-Level Package (`src/agent_framework/`)

Infrastructure layer — entry points, orchestration, and cross-cutting concerns:

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `__init__.py` | Public API surface — re-exports key classes |
| `__main__.py` | CLI entry point — argument parsing, run/evaluate dispatch |
| `agent.py` | Compatibility facade — re-exports everything from `agents/` |
| `config.py` | Configuration loading — `HostConfig` dataclass, `.env` parser |
| `host.py` | `AgentHost` — central orchestrator, headless invocation, `run_tool_loop()` |
| `model_overrides.py` | Typed run-scoped model override helpers used by host/evaluator surfaces |
| `model.py` | `ModelDriver`/`AsyncModelDriver` protocols, `ModelContext`, `ModelResponse`, `DriverCapabilities`, `ModelDriverBase`, `merge_runtime_system_into_messages`, `OpenAiModelDriver`, adapters, system prompt templates |
| `tool.py` | `Tool` base class, `ToolDefinition`, markdown-based tool loading |
| `errors.py` | `ModelDriverError`, `ConversationNotFoundError` — structured error types |
| `messages.py` | `ChatMessage`, `ContentPart`, `ImageUrl`, `FunctionCall`, `ToolCallMessage` — typed multimodal message model |
| `conversation.py` | `ConversationStore`, `AsyncConversationStore` protocols, `InMemoryConversationStore` |
| `validation.py` | `_normalize_json_text` — private fence-stripping primitive used by drivers |
| `audit_trace.py` | `InMemoryAuditTracer`, `AgentCallAuditRecord` — immutable JSONL audit trail |
| `tracing.py` | `TraceEvent`, `TraceContext`, `CompositeRuntimeTracer`, `NullRuntimeTracer` — unified observability pipeline |
| `tracing_bridge.py` | `active_tracer_scope`, `try_publish_trace` — contextvar for tracer + overlay during runs |
| `runtime_trace_behavior.py` | `RuntimeTraceBehavior` — host-attached `runtime.*` emissions from agent hooks |
| `tracing_subscribers/` | `JsonlTraceSubscriber`, `LlmTraceFileSubscriber` — file sinks |
| `tracing_consumers/` | `LoggingTraceHandler` — Python logging → `system.log` events |
| `web_communication.py` | `WebUserCommunication` — browser/session queue bridge |
| `web_host.py` | `create_web_host` — host factory with tracer + web comm |
| `evaluator.py` | `AgentPromptEvaluator`, `OpenAiConversationEvaluator`, `RecordingAgentHost` |
| `llm_trace_logging.py` | `LlmTraceLogger` + dual-publish of `llm.*` to `host.runtime_tracer` when enabled |
| `trace_logging.py` | `TraceLoggingBehavior` — console lifecycle tracing; optional mirror into unified tracer |

### Evaluator package (`src/agent_framework_evaluator/`)

Shipped next to the core package (same distribution, `[web]` extra): local **FastAPI** app, **WebSocket** trace streaming, **`SessionRunner`** (setup modules + `run_agent`), and **`agent-eval`** / `python -m agent_framework_evaluator` CLI. User-facing guide: [Using the agent evaluator](../guides/using-agent-evaluator.md).

The evaluator now transports an explicit agent-run model override contract:

- selected override model name
- override scope: `root_only` or `all_agents`

UI defaults can come from initializer hooks, but the runtime remains the source of truth for how those scopes are applied.

### Drivers Subpackage (`src/agent_framework/drivers/`)

Optional provider drivers that require additional dependencies:

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `drivers/__init__.py` | Package init — exports `DialChatCompletionsDriver` |
| `drivers/dial.py` | `DialChatCompletionsDriver` — async driver for DIAL (OpenAI-compatible chat completions). Requires `[dial]` extra. |

### Agents Subpackage (`src/agent_framework/agents/`)

Agent runtime layer — one class per file discipline. Each file exports exactly one public class:

**Core classes:**
- `agent.py` — `Agent` (1289 lines — the complete decision loop)
- `agent_run.py` — `AgentRun` (per-invocation mutable state)
- `agent_decision.py` — `AgentDecision` (normalized model decision)
- `agent_result.py` — `AgentResult` (run outcome)
- `agent_behavior.py` — `AgentBehavior` (behavior extension base)
- `sequential_hook.py` — `SequentialHook` (callback collection)
- `call_context.py` — `CallContext` (call edge tracking)
- `helpers.py` — shared utility functions (not a class)

**Contract types:**
- `agent_parameter.py` — `AgentParameter`
- `agent_invocation.py` — `AgentInvocation`
- `agent_host_protocol.py` — `AgentHostProtocol` (Protocol)

**Events (10):** `AgentStartEvent`, `AgentEndEvent`, `ModelStartEvent`, `ModelEndEvent`, `ToolStartEvent`, `ToolEndEvent`, `SubagentStartEvent`, `SubagentEndEvent`, `SkillStartEvent`, `SkillEndEvent`

**Hook decisions (4):** `AgentHookDecision`, `AgentEndHookDecision`, `ToolHookDecision`, `SubagentHookDecision`

**System prompt templates (4 `.md` files):** `system.md`, `system.decision.md`, `system.text.md`, `system.json_object.md`

---

## 6. Dependency Structure

The package has a strict, acyclic dependency structure:

```
__main__  ──────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                        │
    ▼                                        ▼
  host  ──────────────────────────────► evaluator
    │                                        │
    ├──► config (no internal deps)           │
    │                                        │
    ├──► model (no internal deps)  ◄─────────┤
    │        ▲                               │
    ├──► agents/ ─────────────────────────────┘
    │        │
    ├──► tool ─► model (ToolDefinition in payloads)
    │
    ├──► errors (no internal deps)
    │
    ├──► messages (no internal deps)
    │
    ├──► conversation ──► errors (ConversationNotFoundError)
    │
    ├──► validation (no internal deps)
    │
    ├──► drivers/dial ──► model, errors, tool, validation
    │
    ├──► audit_trace ──► agents/ (records AgentDecision, events)
    │
    ├──► tracing (no internal framework deps)
    │
    ├──► tracing_bridge ──► tracing
    │
    ├──► runtime_trace_behavior ──► agents/, tracing
    │
    ├──► web_communication ──► tracing_bridge, user_communication
    │
    ├──► web_host ──► host
    │
    ├──► llm_trace_logging ──► model, tracing
    │
    └──► trace_logging ──► agents/, tracing_bridge
```

No circular dependencies. The `model`, `config`, `errors`, `messages`, and `validation` modules are leaves — they depend on nothing else in the package. The `agents/` subpackage depends only on `model`. The `host` aggregates everything.
